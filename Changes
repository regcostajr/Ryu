    New features:
    
    - ->skip_until will filter out any items until the given condition
    is reached (either Future being true, or coderef returning true)

    - better support for sync chains: we now call the `->{on_get}` callback
    recursively if available.

    Developer updates:

    - moved from the old manual dist.ini content to a plugin bundle,
    hopefully this doesn't cause too much breakage

    parent class

    Bugs fixed:

    - resolved some edge cases where handlers can be
    added/removed during callback loops
